//
// Write a recursive function called fib which accepts a number and
// returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the
// Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of whole numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
// ... which starts with 1 and 1, and where every number thereafter is
// equal to the sum of the previous two numbers.
//

/**
 * Returns the nth number in the fibonacci sequence.
 *
 * **NOTE**: It produces the fibonacci sequence as it goes, computing
 * only until necessary to return the correct nth element.
 *
 * **NOTE**: The nth number is in human form, not array, zero-indexed
 * form.  That is, 4th means really the element at the third position of
 * the array of fibonacci numbers.
 *
 * This solution uses a helper function.
 *
 * @param {number} nth â€” The position of the number to be returned.
 * @return {number} â€” The nth number in the fibonacci sequence.
