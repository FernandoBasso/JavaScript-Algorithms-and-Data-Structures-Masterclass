 * **SPACE COMPLEXITY**: `O(1)`. We do not create a new array that grows

  let i = 0, j = 1;

//
// This solution is based on the tips before Colt actually shows any
// code. It involves changing the array and moving all the different
// unique values one after the other to the beginning (left side) of the
// array. When the loop stops, i is at the position of the largest value
// found.
//
// === <1> ===
// ===========
// This solution doesn't attempt to compare with undefined because we
// are looping and checking j, which already starts at 1. If the input
// has  length 1, then j (which starts at 1) is not less thatn
// nums.length and we don't compare numbers against undefined.
//
// === <2> ===
// ===========
// We do not need to swap the elements. In this case, we don't care
// about the state of the array after the computation is performed. We
// just want the number of unique values. It is enough to move [j] to
// the place of updated [i].
//
// === <3> ===
// ===========
// Because arrays start at index 0, and i stops at the last element that
// was different, we have to add 1 to it to return the correct result.
//
// Basically what we return is the length of the portion that we moved
// to the beginning of the array.
//
// In short, this solution involves turning something like this:
//
//   [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]
//
// into:
//
//   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, n, n, n, n, n, n]
//                â†‘
//               /
//              /
// The index of the last unique element after the rearranging. We return
// that index (the index 4, not the value at that index) plus 1.
