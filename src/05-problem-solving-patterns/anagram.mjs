// Examples of anagrams:
//
//            tar = rat
//            arc = car
//          elbow = below
//          state = taste
//          cider = cried
//          dusty = study
//          night = thing
//           inch = chin
//
//      dormitory = dirty room
//  school master = the classroom
//   conversation = voices rant on
//         listen = silent
//     astronomer = moon starer
//       the eyes = they see
//    a gentleman = elegant man
//        funeral = real fun

// To solve it, we must see if the second string has the same frequency
// of letters as in the first string. “iceman” is anagram to “cinema”.
// Each letter in iceman has a corresponding frequency in “cinama” (and
// vice-versa”.
//
// If a string contains spaces, ignore them. E.g.
//
//   “a gentleman” = “elegant man”
//
// When checking for the “anagramness” of the strings, ignore the spaces
// and any other punctuation character.
//
// NOTE: Do not confuse anagrams with palindromes. Palindromes are words
// that are the same if spelled backwards, like “racecar”. If you
// reverse it, it is still “racecar”.
