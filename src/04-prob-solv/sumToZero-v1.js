/**

 * if the array is sorted neither does this function sort it.

 * **TIME COMPLEXITY**: `O(nÂ²)` because we have a nested loop.
 *
 * **SPACE COMPLEXITY**: `O(1)` because we don't use extra space besides
 * the i and j variables.

/*
 * === <1> ===
 * Handles the case where the logic inadvertently compares the sum of
 * 0 + 0 === 0. It could happen if no other pair matches a sum of 0 but
 * we have a 0 in the array, and the indexes in loop are the same for
 * the left and right pointers.
 *
 * So, if for example we have the list [-1, 0, 2], and l = 1 and r = 1,
 * then ints[l] + ints[r] === 0, and we would INCORRECTLY return a pair
 * of [0, 0].
 *
 * We may have a pair [0, 0] if our input array actually contains two
 * zeroes. For example, [-1, 0, 0, 2, 3], then we would find a pair
 * [0, 0] which when summed is zero, and it would be correct.
